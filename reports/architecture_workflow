High-Level Architecture
1. Data Ingestion
Source: Customer transaction data (e.g., from banking systems, CRM, or external APIs).

Azure Services:

Azure Data Factory: Orchestrates data pipelines to ingest data from various sources.

Azure Event Hubs: Real-time ingestion of streaming transaction data.

Azure Blob Storage: Stores raw transaction data files (e.g., CSV, JSON).

Workflow:
Transaction data is ingested in real-time via Azure Event Hubs or batch-processed using Azure Data Factory.

Raw data is stored in Azure Blob Storage for further processing.

2. Data Processing
Azure Services:

Azure Databricks: For data preprocessing, feature engineering, and collaborative filtering.

Azure Synapse Analytics: For large-scale data processing and SQL-based transformations.

Azure Functions: For lightweight, event-driven processing (e.g., triggering data pipelines).

Workflow:
Raw data is cleaned, transformed, and enriched using Azure Databricks or Azure Synapse Analytics.

Feature engineering is performed to create customer profiles (e.g., tenure, transaction frequency, spending patterns).

Data is prepared for machine learning and stored in a structured format.

3. Data Storage
Azure Services:

Azure SQL Database: Stores structured customer and transaction data.

Azure Cosmos DB: Stores NoSQL data for flexible schema (e.g., customer behavior logs).

Azure Data Lake Storage: Stores processed data for machine learning and analytics.

Workflow:
Processed data is stored in Azure SQL Database for structured queries.

Customer behavior logs and metadata are stored in Azure Cosmos DB for fast, flexible access.

Large datasets for machine learning are stored in Azure Data Lake Storage.

4. Machine Learning
Azure Services:

Azure Machine Learning (AML): For training and deploying the sequential recommendation model.

Azure Cognitive Services: For integrating LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT) to generate personalized messages.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): For deploying the recommendation model as a scalable API.

Workflow:
The sequential recommendation model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) is trained using Azure Machine Learning.

The trained model is deployed as a REST API using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Azure Cognitive Services is used to integrate OpenAI GPT for generating personalized messages.

5. User Interaction
Azure Services:

Azure App Service: Hosts the Streamlit web application for user interaction.

Azure API Management: Manages APIs for the recommendation system and LLM integration.

Azure Active Directory (AAD): Provides authentication and authorization for secure access.

Workflow:
The Streamlit web application is hosted on Azure App Service.

Users interact with the app to view recommendations and personalized messages.

The app calls the recommendation API (hosted on AKS) and the LLM API (via Azure Cognitive Services) to generate results.

Azure API Management ensures secure and scalable API access.

6. Monitoring and Logging
Azure Services:

Azure Monitor: Tracks system performance, logs, and metrics.

Azure Log Analytics: Provides insights into application and infrastructure logs.

Application Insights: Monitors the performance of the Streamlit app and APIs.

Workflow:
Azure Monitor collects metrics and logs from all components (e.g., AKS, App Service, Databricks).

Log Analytics is used to query and analyze logs for troubleshooting.

Application Insights monitors the Streamlit app for performance and user behavior.

7. Security and Compliance
Azure Services:

Azure Key Vault: Stores and manages secrets (e.g., API keys, database credentials).

Azure Security Center: Provides threat protection and security recommendations.

Azure Policy: Ensures compliance with organizational and regulatory standards.

Workflow:
Sensitive data (e.g., OpenAI API keys) is stored in Azure Key Vault.

Azure Security Center monitors the system for vulnerabilities and threats.

Azure Policy enforces compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).

Workflow
Step 1: Data Ingestion
Transaction data is ingested from banking systems into Azure Event Hubs or Azure Blob Storage.

Azure Data Factory orchestrates the ingestion process.

Step 2: Data Processing
Data is cleaned, transformed, and enriched using Azure Databricks or Azure Synapse Analytics.

Features like customer tenure, transaction frequency, and spending patterns are extracted.

Step 3: Data Storage
Processed data is stored in Azure SQL Database and Azure Cosmos DB.

Large datasets for machine learning are stored in Azure Data Lake Storage.

Step 4: Machine Learning
The sequential recommendation model is trained using Azure Machine Learning.

The model is deployed as a REST API using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

Azure Cognitive Services integrates OpenAI GPT for personalized messages.

Step 5: User Interaction
The Streamlit web application is hosted on Azure App Service.

Users interact with the app to view recommendations and personalized messages.

APIs are managed and secured using Azure API Management.

Step 6: Monitoring and Logging
Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights track system performance and user behavior.

Step 7: Security and Compliance
Azure Key Vault manages secrets, while Azure Security Center and Azure Policy ensure security and compliance.

Benefits of Using Azure
Scalability: Azure services like AKS and Event Hubs scale automatically to handle large workloads.

Security: Built-in security features (e.g., Key Vault, Security Center) protect sensitive data.

Integration: Seamless integration between Azure services simplifies development and deployment.

Cost-Effectiveness: Pay-as-you-go pricing ensures cost efficiency.

Compliance: Azure meets global compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
